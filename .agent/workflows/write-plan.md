# Writing Plans
*Adapted from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)*

## Overview
Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context. Document everything: which files to touch, complete code, testing steps, expected output. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity
Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):
- "Write the failing test" — step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" — step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" — step
- "Commit" — step

## Plan Document Header
Every plan MUST start with:
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]
**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]
**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]
---
```

## Task Structure
```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**
[Complete test code]

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
[Complete implementation code]

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**
```

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits
